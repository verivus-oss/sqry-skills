# sqry for Mistral Vibe

Use this skill to drive sqry v20.0.5 semantic code search from the Mistral Vibe CLI (`vibe`). The `sqry` CLI works in every Vibe session; MCP is configured through Vibe's TOML config when you want sqry tools available natively.

## Setup

Install or upgrade sqry:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verivus-oss/sqry/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --component all
sqry --version
sqry-mcp --version
sqry-lsp --version
sqryd --version
```

Install or upgrade Mistral Vibe (separate from sqry; Vibe ships via uv):

```bash
uv tool install --upgrade mistral-vibe
vibe --version
```

Index the project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
sqry index .
sqry index --status --json .
```

## MCP Configuration

Vibe configures MCP servers in TOML, not JSON. Add a `[[mcp_servers]]` table to `~/.vibe/config.toml` (Vibe uses stdio, http, and streamable-http transports; sqry runs over stdio):

```toml
[[mcp_servers]]
name = "sqry"
transport = "stdio"
command = "/absolute/path/to/sqry-mcp"
args = ["--no-daemon"]
```

For a project-scoped config, set `VIBE_HOME` to a local `.vibe` directory (for example `export VIBE_HOME=/path/to/project/.vibe`) and place `config.toml` there.

API keys and provider credentials live in `~/.vibe/.env`, not `config.toml`. Vibe's CLI does not yet support MCP servers that require OAuth. sqry over stdio is unaffected.

Restart Vibe after editing `config.toml`. Verify with the `/config` command inside Vibe.

### MCP mode: standalone vs daemon

**Default:** standalone `sqry-mcp` (no `--daemon`, or `--no-daemon`). Serves **37 tools** and **6 MCP resources** including `sqry://meta/manifest` and `sqry://docs/*`.

**Daemon** (`sqry-mcp --daemon`) warms the graph for long sessions but exposes only a **16-tool subset** and **zero MCP resources** — agents cannot read `sqry://meta/manifest` or docs on the daemon path. Do not configure daemon then instruct reading MCP resources in the same workflow.

```bash
# Standalone — full tools + resources (preferred)
sqry-mcp --no-daemon

# Daemon — warm graph, reduced tools, no resources
sqry daemon start
sqry daemon load .
sqry-mcp --daemon
```

```toml
args = ["--daemon"]   # only when you accept the 16-tool, no-resource tradeoff
```

## Redaction for external LLMs

Set `SQRY_REDACTION_PRESET` in the process environment before launching `sqry-mcp` (Vibe does not always expose per-server env in TOML — use a wrapper script or shell export if needed). Presets: `none|minimal|standard|strict` (default `minimal`). See `sqry-mcp --help` and the `sqry-mcp-redaction` README in the sqry repo.

## Skill Dependency

Also load `sqry-semantic-search`. It contains the shared routing rules, CLI fallback commands, ambiguity handling, output-size limits, and rebuild recovery steps.

## Tool Naming

When sqry is configured under the name `sqry`, Vibe exposes its tools under that server name. Read `sqry://meta/manifest` first on **standalone** MCP when resources are available, then use `sqry://docs/capability-map` and `sqry://docs/tool-guide` for the exact installed tool surface. When MCP is unavailable, ignore tool naming and use the CLI.

## CLI Fallback

Vibe can run shell commands via its `bash` tool, so the CLI is a reliable path whenever MCP is not connected. From the workspace root:

```bash
sqry query 'kind:function AND name:authenticate' --json
sqry graph direct-callers "AuthService::authenticate" --json
sqry impact "AuthService::authenticate" --json
sqry cycles --json
sqry diff HEAD~1 HEAD --json
sqry ask "where is the retry logic implemented?"
```

## Recommended System-Prompt Addition

Vibe routes behaviour through custom system prompts, not an `AGENTS.md`. Create a markdown file in `~/.vibe/prompts/` (for example `sqry.md`) and set `system_prompt_id = "sqry"` in `config.toml`, or append this guidance to your existing custom prompt:

```markdown
## Code Search

For structural code questions — callers, callees, references, imports,
call paths, dependency impact, cycles, unused symbols, semantic diffs —
prefer sqry (CLI or MCP tools when connected) over grep and file-read tools.
Use grep for literal text search and file listing for filename discovery.

On C code, sqry call edges can carry resolution provenance and ambiguous calls
are elided rather than guessed, so an absent edge means "not confidently
resolvable," not "does not exist." For sensitive or regulated repositories,
set `SQRY_REDACTION_PRESET=standard` (or `strict`) before launching sqry-mcp.
```

## Troubleshooting

- Tools not visible: restart Vibe after editing `config.toml`; verify with `/config`.
- Local tools disappeared after adding an MCP server: Vibe's tool allow-list can shadow built-in local tools when MCP is enabled. Re-enable them in your tool permissions (for example with a `*` wildcard) so `bash`, `read`, and `write_file` remain available.
- Name collision: if a same-named MCP binary is also discoverable on `PATH`, Vibe may pick the wrong one. Use an absolute `command` path and a distinct server `name`.
- Empty results: run `sqry index .` from the project root, or `sqry index --force .` after an upgrade or stale graph warning.
- Stale graph or unknown plugin IDs: remove `.sqry/graph`, `.sqry/graphs`, and `.sqry/analysis`, then rebuild.
- Cannot read `sqry://meta/manifest`: switch to standalone `sqry-mcp --no-daemon` (daemon serves zero resources).
- Fewer tools than expected: you are likely on daemon-hosted MCP. Use standalone `sqry-mcp` for the full surface.
- 404 on `sqry://meta/manifest`: old server version; upgrade sqry.
